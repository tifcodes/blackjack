1) create a deck of cards (produce a card array)
create a function that would go through all the values and suits in an array
using for loop create a deck of the suits and values 
use the push function to add it to the array
currently the cards will be all in exact order

2) shuffle deck of cards
create a function and go through the iteration  
using for loop around 500 times to get a randomize order
to randomize use Math.floor and Math.random

3) deal the card to the player first 
using on click event when they hit new game -> deal new cards
to get a card from array use .pop

4) dealer and player1 cards (show cards)
push the card to the array
append it to the html

5) add cards (banker and player)
create a function that would add the cards of the player and the banker
if (j, q k) {
    then 10
} else
return value number


6) player1 (hit, stand, new game)
if (player hits "hit") {
    then get a new card
} else if (player hits stand) {
    then stop
    then shows the dealer's hand
} else if (dealer > 22) {
    then bust
}

7) if dealers hit 17 no need cards, but lower than 17 get more cards
if (dealer < 17) {
    then get a new card
} else if (dealer > 17 and dealer <=21) {
    then stop
} else if (dealer > 22) {
    then bust
}

// if cards runs out, new deck
